Full Summary of Dune by Frank Herbert

In the distant future, the galaxy runs on a powerful substance called melange, or spice. It grants extended life, heightened awareness, and is essential for space travel. The spice exists only on the desert planet Arrakis, a hostile world ruled by giant sandworms and inhabited by the secretive Fremen people.

House Atreides, led by Duke Leto, is ordered by Emperor Shaddam IV to take control of Arrakis, replacing their longtime enemies, House Harkonnen. It’s a trap. The Emperor, fearing Leto’s rising popularity, conspires with the Harkonnens to destroy House Atreides.

Leto moves to Arrakis with his concubine Lady Jessica and their son Paul. Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a secretive sisterhood breeding a superbeing called the Kwisatz Haderach. Paul, born from a defiance of the plan, begins to show signs that he might be that figure.

Soon after arrival, the Harkonnens—with the Emperor’s elite troops—launch a surprise attack. Leto is killed. Paul and Jessica barely escape into the deep desert and are taken in by the Fremen. Paul earns their respect and takes the name Muad’Dib. Spice exposure triggers his prescient visions. He starts to see all possible futures—and the terrifying holy war that could erupt in his name.

Paul becomes a religious and military leader among the Fremen. He trains them in guerrilla warfare and leads a campaign to sabotage spice production. Meanwhile, he embraces his destiny, surviving a deadly ritual with the Water of Life that expands his consciousness and confirms he is the Kwisatz Haderach.

As chaos builds, the Emperor arrives on Arrakis to suppress the rebellion. Paul strikes. Using control over the sandworms and the desert itself, he defeats the Harkonnen forces and the Emperor’s troops. He forces the Emperor to abdicate, takes his daughter Irulan as wife (for political legitimacy), and seizes control of Arrakis and the spice.

By the end, Paul holds absolute power. But his victory feels hollow—he knows a galactic jihad will follow in his name, no matter what he does to stop it.
